# Project Proposal
Study Time!

## What is the Project?
A web application where you can create study "events" and label them with the topic/class of study so that you can find other students studying the same thing.

### Why is it important?
There are plenty of students who want to meet more of their peers, get help with their homework, or just do better when studying around others. 
## For Whom?
At least to start, the audience is NYU students. 
## How?
- User account creation that allows for people to publish their schedules on the platform 
- Group creation and invitation 
- Algorithm to find users with the same or similar classes (presented in a most relevant result format)
- Individual and group chat features
## Scope 
I believe that the features listed prior are relatively simple for undergraduate college students studying computer science to implement. The success of the application will rely on the UI being intuitive to most users, as well as the graphics created by frontend development.
